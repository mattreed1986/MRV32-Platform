The MRV32 Platform: A Custom RV32 Soft-Core Processor and Experimental Operating System 

OVERVIEW	
	
	The MRV32 Platform is a combined synthesizable RV32 soft-core and minimal, bare-metal trap/syscall-based OS. It is written in Verilog HDL and C, with some 32 bit machine code, and has been tested on the Basys 3 FPGA by Digilent. 
	MRV32 was conceived in the spirit of autodidactic learning, experimentation, and education for those interested in soft-core CPU design. It was an attempt at creating a whole, working system that runs (ported) third party software, implementing the RV32IM ISA. It is inspired by Ben Eater's Youtube Channel, digital ham radio, and "Digital Computer Electronics" by Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald Brown.
	Key features of the MRV32 Platform are as follows: RV32IM instruction set architecture, centralized hardware control with multiple fixed datapaths, UART connectivity, and a minimal shell and kernel OS reminiscent of earlier Unix (file descriptors and syscalls).
	The MIT license applies to both the platform's OS and hardware.


SOFT-CORE OVERVIEW

	The MRV32 Platform's hardware can be described as centrally controlled with a point-to-point datapath. Most of the control signals branch out from the centralized control module, with the remainder coming from the trap unit, which manages the direction to trap vectors in the event of syscalls and reception and transmission interrupts. The point to point nature of the modules' connectivity can be seen in the diagram. Please see the following Architecture sections for a more detailed description of the hardware and software architecture.

HOW TO BUILD THE CORE (WITH INCLUDED OS AND USER PROGRAMS)

	Though the platform was designed for use on a Basys 3 FPGA, it can probably be built for other FPGAs too. That said, these instructions will assume that the Basys 3 is being used with Vivado.
	First, Vivado will need to be installed. It can be downloaded from the AMD website. Either Windows or Linux should do, though it has been tested on Linux. The version that is known to be good is 2025.2. If installing in Linux, the tar archive installation may be necessary.
	A serial terminal program will also be needed. Putty has been found to work well.
	Once Vivado is installed, start it and create a new project. In the project creation, upload the source (.v) files and the constraint (.xdc) file. If an FPGA other than the Basys 3 is being used, a different constraint file will have to be made up. If a new constraint file is being made up, it will need a clock and rx and tx UART pins. Once the files are in Vivado and the project is created, the clock speed will have to be modified in order for the soft-core to run on a Basys 3. Other FPGAs may not need this. The clock speed can be modified via the Clocking Wizard IP (intellectual property). In Vivado 2025.2, go to Window -> IP Catalog, and search for "clocking wizard". Set up the new clock in the wizard. An arbitrary working clock is 50 MHz for the Basys 3. It will be necessary to insert an instantiation of the clocking wizard that matches the newly generated clocking wizard module. It can be adjusted to be faster as long as the WNS (worst negative slack) and WHS (worst hold slack) are not negative and the UART timing counters are adjusted. After the clocking wizard is set up, just generate the bitstream, wait for it to finish, open the hardware manager, connect to your device, open Putty for your serial device at 9600 baud (or whatever baud rate you have modified it to), and Program Device in Vivado. You should see the prompt in your Putty window.
	
	
HOW TO RUN THE OS

	As is, the OS is simple. It currently comes with two ported, third party user programs: TinyBasicLike and Kilo. TinyBasicLike is a Tiny Basic interpreter that can also be used to create new Tiny Basic programs. Kilo is a small text editor. Tiny Basic programs can be created either in TinyBasicLike or Kilo, though it is the author's opinion that for the purpose of greater editability, Kilo is more convenient. The .bas file created in Kilo can be run in TinyBasicLike. The licenses for the user programs are in their respective files in the repository.
	To run a program, simply type in its name. If you type something that does not match a directory table entry, the shell will print "INVALID COMMAND" and give you a new prompt. The exact, case sensitive names of the two programs are Basic and Kilo.

	
KNOWN FUNCTIONING SYNTHESIS TOOLS AND SIMULATORS

	So far, the only tested synthesis tool for MRV32 is Vivado. The reader is encouraged to try synthesizing MRV32 on other tools and letting the author know whether they work.
	Icarus Verilog and a UART testbench were used to simulate and troubleshoot the platform. The testbench has been included in the repository. It is useful for testing boot and user program startup functionality. It works by supplying a clock to the top soft-core module, waiting a predetermined amount of time, and then triggering a UART transmission into the soft-core.
	There are a few steps to setting up the testbench, but it is not a long or tedious process. Instructions are as follows:
	
	-Comment out the clock wizard instantiation in the top module of the device under test (the soft-core), and set the clock inputs to have the same name as the clocks that are going into each module.
	-Decide what command you want to issue to the soft-core, and translate it into ASCII characters. Put the ASCII characters into the buffer in the initialization of the tbUART module inside the testbench file.
	-Insert a delay in the initialization of the top of the testbench that is long enough to get through the kernel boot/prompt process. 
	-After the delay, at the desired time of UART transmission, set tx_trig to 1. This will initiate the UART transmission process from testbench to soft-core. 
	-It is also necessary to include another delay after the tx_trig that is long enough to both transmit the UART command and watch an appropriate amount of debug info to investigate whatever you are trying to solve.
	
	In the top module of the soft-core, there is a reg called "indicators." Set this to "1" if it is desired to turn on selected debug info that the author has found helpful. 
	
	
HOW TO START DESIGNING YOUR OWN SOFT-CORES

	Designing a soft-core CPU can be a fun and rewarding challenge. The author feels that it is definitely within reach of most people that are willing to learn and have genuine interest in computers and how they work. There are really only two ingredients to getting started: knowing how the CPUs work and being able to code them. Here, a path will be presented to those interested in taking it on.
	The SAP (simple as possible) computers, presented in the book "Digital Computer Electronics" by Albert Malvino and Jerald Brown, are a good first step to learning about how computer processors and their surrounding systems work. These computers have a limited number of modules and relatively straight forward operation. SAP 1 can even be built on breadboards and programmed with switches. The book is written so that it is possible to understand the SAP computers without much extra reading. Buying a hard copy is encouraged.
	While learning the SAP computers, it is encouraged to start trying to code them in Verilog and simulate them. It won't be easy at first. Though Verilog's similarity to C makes it relatively intuitive, there will be obstacles at first. It would be good to look up and work through some online tutorials first. Start simple and work your way up. Get a Verilog handbook. "Verilog HDL: A Guide to Digital Design and Synthesis" by Samir Palnitkar is a good one.
	The next level of coding in Verilog is synthesizability. Getting a Basys 3 or similar entry level FPGA and trying to run your Verilog on it is really the final hurdle to designing soft-core CPUs, and it is very satisfying. Getting the FPGA to cooperate can be a frustration, but it's a major victory when you succeed, and it really feels good. Also, once you know what works and what doesn't, the hardware bugs get fewer and farther between.
	

NOTES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

	Soft-core, OS, and user program source files have been included. With these files, the user should be able to simulate the soft-core as is with the OS, modify either the hardware or the software, or add new or different user programs. It is hoped that the author's journey in producing this work will spark interest in FPGA work and soft-core and OS development.
	The author was not the sole contributor to the porting of TinyBasicLike and Kilo. The user programs' licenses are included in the repository.
